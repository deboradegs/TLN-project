## Esercitazione #6 - "Let'splay" - False Friends

### Corpus
Il corpus è composto da un file (`text_emotion.csv`) contente 40000 tweet su svariati argomenti, preso dal progetto https://github.com/ragesh2000/Emotion-detection , resi un testo solo. Abbiamo scelto un corpus così vasto e vario poiché negli altri che abbiamo provato era difficile trovare parole identiche ma usate con diversi significati, se non impossibile.

### Idea
Per trovare gli omonimi in un testo abbiamo pensato di usare la libreria lesk, che è in grado di disambiguare una parola dato il contesto in cui è inserita. Inoltre restituisce, grazie al metodo definition(), la definizione del concetto che è stato disambiguato. A questo punto abbiamo creato un dataframe di parole che avessero più di una definizione in tutto il testo con le relative definizioni, e le chiavi di questo dataframe sono i nostri omonimi, o false friends.
