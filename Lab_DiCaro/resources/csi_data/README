===== Data =====

The package contains the following files:
- inventory.txt, which contains the list of 45 CSI labels. 
- wn_synset2csi.txt, which contains the mapping between wordnet and CSI labels. WordNet synsets are identified by means of their offset. We used WordNet 3.0. The file is formatted as follows:
each line contains a wordnet it and a list of CSI labels. Each field is separated by <tab>.
For example:
wn:13742358n<tab>MATHEMATICS_<tab>NUMISMATICS_AND_CURRENCIES_
indicates that the WordNet synset wn:13742358n is associated with the CSI labels MATHEMATICS_ and NUMISMATICS_AND_CURRENCIES_.
