phpbb.com,"<s> i tried to get an organization to use a phpBB forum for discussions, and they hated it. they are used to email discussions. they used a basic email discussion-list, with one big distribution list. every post got emailed to all members. problem was that a single distribution list was made to support multiple simultaneous discussions, so people got too much mail, and threads got lost in the mess. i discovered mail-based discussion by jkn. they are no longer available, and i''ve been searching for a replacement. here''s how their awesome interface looked: http://tinyurl.com/b48lvn the great things about jkn is that i could seed multiple discussions to the whole group, and then members could subscribe only to those discussions of interest to them. member would not receive follow-ups to threads they were not subscribed to. jkn created separate distribution lists on the fly, and kept threads isolated from each other. and my users avoided the email avalanche on topics they didnt care about. jkn would display the entire thread in the email, in compact form, so users never had to visit the web-interface-- they could do everything in email. this is just awesome for users who are email-centric. and, if they wanted, they could visit the web interface to read thread they were not subscribed"

noone.org,"<s> Following a coworker''s idea of adding ""both servers"" to the search term, I found Debian bug #563449 (dhcp3-server: Incorrect ""peer holds all free leases"" log entries) which turned out as configuration error or at least unexpected configuration (machine was blocked from getting an IP on purpose) and misleading error messages. </s>"
noone.org,<s> So I checked under which circumstances this computer would not get an IP despite it had a static IP configured: </s>
noone.org,<s> That computer would not get an IP address in any subnet which has different IP range and no dynamic IP addresses. </s>
noone.org,"<s> And even if I comment out the ""fixed-address"" setting, it wouldn''t get an IP in any static-IPs-only subnet either. </s>"
noone.org,"<s> So if you get the ""peer holds all free leases"" error message from both your DHCP servers, chances are very high that the mentioned MAC address should really not get an IP address on this network (as it does :-). </s>"
