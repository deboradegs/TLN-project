phpbb.com,"<s> i tried to get an organization to use a phpBB forum for discussions, and they hated it. they are used to email discussions. they used a basic email discussion-list, with one big distribution list. every post got emailed to all members. problem was that a single distribution list was made to support multiple simultaneous discussions, so people got too much mail, and threads got lost in the mess. i discovered mail-based discussion by jkn. they are no longer available, and i''ve been searching for a replacement. here''s how their awesome interface looked: http://tinyurl.com/b48lvn the great things about jkn is that i could seed multiple discussions to the whole group, and then members could subscribe only to those discussions of interest to them. member would not receive follow-ups to threads they were not subscribed to. jkn created separate distribution lists on the fly, and kept threads isolated from each other. and my users avoided the email avalanche on topics they didnt care about. jkn would display the entire thread in the email, in compact form, so users never had to visit the web-interface-- they could do everything in email. this is just awesome for users who are email-centric. and, if they wanted, they could visit the web interface to read thread they were not subscribed"
